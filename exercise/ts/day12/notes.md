- ChildrenRepository sounds ethically incorrect
- Is child name unique?
- mix undefined & Error

  - Only One Level Of Indentation Per Method
  - Don’t Use The ELSE Keyword
  - Wrap All Primitives And Strings
  - First Class Collections
  - One Dot Per Line
  - Don’t Abbreviate
  - Keep All Entities Small
  - No Classes With More Than Two Instance Variables
  - No Getters/Setters/Properties
- TODO mob.sh
- why no return types in TS?
