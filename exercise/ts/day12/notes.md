- trying mob.sh
- ChildrenRepository sounds ethically incorrect
- Is child name unique?
- mix undefined & Error
- early returns in long method
- behaviour should be enum -> no more undefined
- object calisthenics [source](https://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/#tldr)
  - Only One Level Of Indentation Per Method
  - Don’t Use The ELSE Keyword
  - Wrap All Primitives And Strings
  - First Class Collections
  - One Dot Per Line
  - Don’t Abbreviate
  - Keep All Entities Small
  - No Classes With More Than Two Instance Variables
  - No Getters/Setters/Properties
- TODO mob.sh
- why no return types in TS?
- this. does not count towards OC, right?
- what would this look like in TS idiomatic?
- TODO should we throw in our santa method 
- Contiue.dev with GPT-4o is crazy:
  - Prompt: make Child.behaviour not only introduced enum, but also resolved other TODOs (make childrenRepository a first-class collection)
  - Prompt: make Child.behaviour an enum, but don't resolve any TODOs (did as expected)
