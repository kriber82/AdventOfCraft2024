# Thoughts contributing to my solution

- first hunch: constructor-inject logger, as it probably is
  - useful for many methods in communication
  - will be the same for all methods and calls
  - won't change at runtime
- guesses about business rules
  - reindeer name strongly hints at a reindeer entity
  - currentLocation also seems to relate to the reindeer
  - numberOfDaysForComingBack
    - is probably be related to currentLocation
    - might also be dependent on speed of the reindeer (no hint for or against that in the code)
  - numberOfDaysBeforeChristmas is probably only dependent on the current date
- refactoring step: extract reindeer with name & location
- observation: two main concepts besides reindeers: time & location
- refactoring: try to capture time as a concept
  - introduce today and christmasDay as LocalDates to replace numberOfDaysBeforeChristmas
    - assumption: Communicator will be reconstructed regularly
- idea: introduce NavigationService as a dependency for numberOfDaysForComingBack
  - would need baseLocation
  - would need some kind of test stub to inject value for numberOfDaysForComingBack
  - would feel wrong to pass in strings as locations
    - refactoring: Introduce Location wrapper around string to better represent intention of those strings
- understood from composed message content: resting time is the time reindeers need to rest at base before christmas
  - refactor: make that clear through constructor parameter name & explanatory variable
