- totalToys == 0
- age < 0
- setup of pitest not straightforward
  - failed due to junit-jupiter missing in dependencies
  - maven tests ran despite missing dep
  - failure output of pitest hard interpret
- can call maven commands in intellij via button on top (despite no local installation of mvn)
- pitest results:
  - private constructor is not covered, but we'll leave that as is, as it prevents constructing the static class
  - added some tests at the age boundaries for categorize gift
- will try [datafaker](https://www.datafaker.net/) to add random data tests
  - datafaker is pretty simple to set up and use with parameterized tests
  - readability for more than one parameter via @MethodSource is not great
  - suspected "division by 0" is not a problem for doubles
  - finding edge cases like div by zero would take huge amounts of time with randomized values
    - datafaker seems to be aimed more at anonymizing data, and maybe property based testing
    - are fuzzing libs better at detecting corner cases?  
- review of pitest findings:
  - ! can alter doubles in ensureToyBalance without a test failing
- toying with jazzer
  - found div by zero problems in several variations (+/- small constants, +/- other var) rather quickly
    - to introduce div by zero, i changed `(double) toysCount / totalToys` to variations of `(double) (toysCount / totalToys)`
- more toying with pitest, trying to get it to detect the bad detection of double constant changes
  - using STRONGER and ALL mutations did not help
  - found no docs of more double mutators in arcmutate (paid extension), but didn't bother to try
  - gave up and created additional testcases without a tool telling me to
- tried again with jqwik
  - dead simple to setup
  - nice detection of several non-trivial div by zero bugs
